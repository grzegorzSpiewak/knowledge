## A. Informat

Lodash makes JavaScript easier by taking the hassle out of working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc.
Lodashâ€™s modular methods are great for:

1) Iterating arrays, objects, & strings
2) Manipulating & testing values
3) Creating composite functions

## B. How this projects works?

Server/index.js allows to test all Lodash options just type in testing function and hit npm start to see the result in console window.
